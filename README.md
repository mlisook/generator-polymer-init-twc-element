# generator-polymer-init-twc-element
Generator for Polymer 2.0 Custom Element using Typescript and TWC

`TWC` (Typed Web Components - see [Draccoz/twc](https://github.com/Draccoz/twc) for details) allows developers to use Typescript and decorators to create Polymer custom elements. `TWC` acts as a compiler, translating the Typescript into Polymer ES6 class based elements. There is no runtime library - everything happens in the build step.

This generator is based on the Polymer init custom element generator, of course.
